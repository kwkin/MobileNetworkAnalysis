# DHCP_static_analysis
Some scripts used to analyze and visualize DHCP logs and pedestrian traffic on a university campus. Additional scripts are added to present expiremental measurements of bluetoosh RSSI. The plots are created using Matplotlib. 

## Sample Plots
The following contains a subset of generated plots.

### DHCP Analysis
![DHCP Events](/img/Monday_2012-04-09_1min.png)

DHCP events grouped in 1 minute bins. If a timestamp intersects the bin time, then an event is added to the corresponding bin. Moreover, if an eventâ€™s start to end timestamps span multiple bins, then an event is added to each of the overlapping bins. The time with the most events is indicated by a yellow annotation and the time with the least events indicated using a pink annotation. 

![DHCP Events With Class Periods](/img/Monday, 2012-04-09_1min_periods.png)

DHCP events grouped in 1 minute bins. The beginning and ending timestamps of class periods is illustrated with an orange and green line.

### Bluetooth RSSI Analysis
![RSSI Analysis](/img/rssi_s1.png)

Bluetooth RSSI compared to the log shadowing model. The advertiser device was a Pocophone F1, and the scanning device was a Pixel 2 XL. The experiment was conducted in a open, empty room. The stationary device was advertising, while the other device was scanning. The advertiser broadcasted at four settings: ultra-low, low, medium, and high. The scanning device was placed at the following distances: 0.5m, 1m, 5m, 10m, 20m, 25m, and 30m. The scanning device was set to record for approximately 8 seconds at each distance, and the measurements were repeated for each power setting. 

![RSSI vs_Distance](/img/galaxy-s8_versus_pocophone_distance.png)

RSSI versus distance in a mobility scenario. The advertiser started at a set at a distance of approximately 10 meters, walked past the advertiser (coming into contact at a minimum of around 1 meter), and stopped at approximately 10 meters in the opposite direction of the sender. This procedure was conducted for classic Bluetooth and each of the transmission power settings.
